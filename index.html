<h1>A History of Surfing</h1>
<h2>In The Beginning</h2>
<p>In the beginning there was light
  Mass and matter. And evolution. Life.</p>

<p>Where did it come from? Who knows. Philosophers and scientists and creationists debate it. We’re all agreed it’s been a bloody long time. Let’s call it eternity.</p>

<p>The moon has mooned. Night after night, day after day. Tides and swells have moved water around the globe.</p>

<p>Seas.</p>

<p>Oceans.</p>

<p>Rock carved.</p>

<p>Continents divided.</p>

<p>Utterly beyond our control.</p>
<p>It’s calmer out there
  You’ve been surfing a handful of times. Aside from that lucky day you found a small wave and had a cruisey few hours, you’re mostly used to dragging your board through the white water. Half the time you’re leaning into the rushing waves, getting whacked time and again, trying your best to remember the basics.</p>

<p>But when you get out the back, there’s a serenity. The “connection to the sea” and “aloha” spirit you hear people touting comes from the calm waters beyond the breakers. You’ll have to deal with bigger waves, and spend some time learning how to handle yourself, but the lulls between waves are worth the challenge.</p>
